This is a version of the BIP39 word list, where you can actually search for the number or word you need, and get both the "human" format and the "math" format of a value.
This way, we can all agree to find the exact word and number combination without relying on bad numbering.

FORMATTING :  word (from the bip39 master list ,
first number (human readable, where the first word is "1" and the second word is "2" and so on) 
second number is the same number but "mathematically correct" where the first word is "0" (not 1) and the second word is "1" ... and so on ... mind you that this is unsupported by many hardware wallets)
ALWAYS pick either the first or always the second number (DO NOT MIX)
